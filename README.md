Game jam game - Invertis

Game concept - Puzzle Platformer with the twist that you can flip gravity. You will have to use this ability to navigate the levels ahead and your massive brain to solve the puzzles ahead. 
(SPACE to invert gravity)

Pico Park like game but not as good and with gravity invertability.
